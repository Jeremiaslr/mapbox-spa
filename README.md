**Do not use directly in AngularCLI** (unless the environment variables are already created), as the environment variables are generated based on the `.env` file.

## Steps:

1. Clone the `.env.template` file and rename it to `.env`.
2. Fill in the environment variables accordingly.
3. Create Angular Envs (optional):
    ```bash
    npm run envs
    ```
4. For development, run:
    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```
5. For production, run:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
